					Understanding the global changemaker network

						The Global Changemaker is a project aimed at fostering intercultural
						exchange and dismantling stereotypes which reinforce inequality. The
						project primarily focuses on{" "}
						<strong>Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG17)</strong>, which
						strongly emphasizes on achieving sustainable development goals
						through global partnerships. Moreover, recognizing that the
						challenges we experience locally, also often have global
						implications, affecting people both in the Global South and North
						similarly. This project highlights the importance of addressing such
						prevalent local issues, through the formation of global
						partnerships. Thus, exploring the projects name “Global”, which is a
						combination of the words “Global” and “Local”, therefore reflecting
						our core mission of bridging local efforts with global impact.

							The Ongoing Model of the Project
						</h3>
						<p>
							The project consists of two face-to-face encounters, each with
							distinct focuses, as well as an intermediate phase between these
							two encounters, where work is done locally in both Germany and
							South Africa. Throughout this process, continuous support and
							networking are provided during the preparation, intermediate and
							follow-up phases.
						</p>
						<h4 className="mt-3 text-lg italic font-medium text-slate-800">
							The First Meeting
						</h4>

						<p>
							In the first meeting, respective representatives from eight NGOs
							(4 from South Africa and 4 from Germany), gathered in Gqeberha.
							During this encounter, they participated in facilitation training,
							workshops on racism and sexism sensitisation, the 2030 SDG Agenda,
							and filmmaking workshops. Additionally, the partners received
							training on implementing the Masifunde Changemaker Network. Before
							concluding this initial meeting, the partners collaboratively
							selected specific SDG’s to address in partnership, with each South
							African NGO pairing with a German NGO. Together, they developed
							“global” project ideas and action plans for their respective
							locations. Which will then be implemented during the intermediate
							phase.
						</p>
						<h4 className="mt-3 text-lg italic font-medium text-slate-800">
							The Intermediate Phase
						</h4>
						<p>
							Now the partners have returned to their home projects, in an aim
							of implementing the developed project ideas and action plans
							formulated in the initial meeting. The main aim of each partner is
							to recruit a minimum of 15 young people (Changemakers), in helping
							them formulate action plans, discussing relevant ideas and topics,
							as well as identifying potential economic, governmental and civil
							society partners. Continuous virtual coaching and mentoring will
							be provided for the NGO’s during this phase, along with
							opportunities for feedback and reflection. Additionally, each NGO
							representative will be responsible for filming and documenting
							their local work, using video cameras provided to them by
							Masifunde.
						</p>
						<h4 className="mt-3 text-lg italic font-medium text-slate-800">
							The Second-Encounter Phase
						</h4>
						<p>
							For this phase, the NGO representatives of the initial encounter
							meet together, along with one young person from each of the local
							projects, in Berlin. Here, experiences of the project will be
							shared, as well as the best practices identified in the project.
							Additionally, all footage documented from the local projects, will
							be placed in a documentary film, by an experienced filmmaker, and
							shown during this final conference.

							Goals of the Glocal Changemaker Network
						</h3>
						<ul className="pl-10 my-3 list-disc">
							<li>
								Provide representatives of local NGOs with knowledge, skills and
								methods to share the 2030 Agenda with young people in their
								local projects, and train them to be Changemakers.
							</li>
							<li>
								Provide an opportunity for the participants, both NGO
								representatives and young Changemakers, to get to develop new
								southern and northern perspectives. Therefore, incorporating
								these perspectives within their project ideas.
							</li>
							<li>
								Provide grounds for the international replicability of the
								Changemaker network, which has been successfully tested and
								implemented in South Africa.
							</li>
							<li>
								Raising the voice of the youth, especially those in marginalized
								groups and sectors of society.
							</li>
							<li>
								Promoting youth engagement, by involving young people as
								Changemakers and activating them in their own local communities.
							</li>
							<li>
								Sustainability of the project, by documenting the work done, and
								sharing the best practices discovered throughout the process.
								Thus, participants know how to best replicate such initiatives,
								within their own contexts.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							In Conclusion, this project contributes to the strengthening of
							international youth work, by providing young people with an
							opportunity of actively participating in social change, while
							gaining intercultural understanding and creating significant
							awareness on global challenges. This initiative not only
							significantly impacts the individual, but also contributes in the
							development of the global network of committed and excited young
							people, working towards a better world.
