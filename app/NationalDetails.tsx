          The Changemaker Network model is a whole-of-school community
          intervention that activates, provides capacity and supports the role
          of local Department of Education and school communities at large:
          learners, educators, community, volunteers, stakeholders. This project
          has been implemented within the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, North
          West and Limpopo.

          Out of the Civil Society Organisations (CSO) that applied, 5 will be
          selected from each province to become implementation partners of the
          MCN. Each CSO will work within 5 schools within their district. Thus,
          resulting in 20 districts and 25 schools per province and ultimately
          100 schools nationwide.
