          The Changemaker Network model is a whole-of-school community
          intervention that activates, provides capacity and supports the role
          of local Department of Education and school communities at large:
          learners, educators, community, volunteers, stake-holders. This
          project has been implemented within the Nelson Mandela Bay and aims to
          work within 45 high schools within this region. It further aims to be
          replicated within 4 provinces in South Africa. Specifically; Eastern
          Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, North West and Limpopo.

          Within these 4 provinces, Civil Society Organisations (CSO) have
          applied and 5 will be selected from each province to become
          implementation partners of the MCN. Each CSO will work within 5
          schools within their district. Thus, resulting in 20 districts and 25
          schools per province and ultimately 100 schools nationwide.

          The Masifunde Changemaker Network (MCN) is one example of such a
          school-based programme. The project aims to capacitate learners with
          practical knowledge on relevant social topics, such as school safety,
          violence and bullying. This is achieved through activation workshops
          for all Grade 9 learners and intensive changemaker trainings for
          selected learners. The training equips learners with practical tools
          to act as agents of change in their schools. They learn campaigning,
          public speaking and in general about the role they and their peers can
          play in initiating change in their direct social environ-ment,
          particularly with regard to addressing interpersonal/gender-based
          violence.

          The programmes can help guide learners that may be exposed to or
          experiencing violence to find coping skills, positive behavioural
          support, or peer-to-peer education. Such programmes can represent safe
          spaces for children to disclose experiences of violence, develop
          leadership skills, change at-risk behaviours and overall improve their
          resilience. Furthermore, this programme makes use of a peer-to-peer
          intervention strategy as it has been proven to work and encourage
          positive influence within schools and communities in general.
